###This C# Azure Function code defines a serverless HTTP-triggered function named Counter, which:

Connects to Azure Cosmos DB

Tracks and stores the number of times the function has been invoked

Returns the current invocation count in a JSON response

üîç What Happens in Detail:
1. Initialization and Setup
The constructor TestHttp() initializes a CosmosClient using the connection string from environment variable CosmosDbConnectionString.

It also initializes a reference to a Cosmos DB container (myDatabase / myContainer).

2. Resource Validation
EnsureCosmosResourcesExistAsync ensures the Cosmos DB database and container exist. If not, they‚Äôre created automatically.

3. HTTP Trigger Function: Run()
This function is triggered by an HTTP GET or POST request.

It logs the start of the request and ensures the Cosmos DB resources exist.

4. Counter Logic
The function attempts to read an item in the container with ID "functionCounter".

If it exists, it increments the count field by 1.

If it doesn't exist, a new document is created with count = 1.

{
  "id": "functionCounter",
  "count": 3
}
5. Upsert Operation
The updated (or new) counter document is upserted back into Cosmos DB. ("Upsert" = insert or update)

6. Response
Returns a JSON response with the updated count and ID:

{
  "count": 3,
  "id": "functionCounter"
}
7. Error Handling
If there's a Cosmos DB error (like permissions or connection issues), it returns the appropriate status code.

General exceptions are logged and result in HTTP 500.

‚úÖ Summary

Component	Purpose
TestHttp class	Azure Function class handling HTTP requests
CosmosClient	Connects to Azure Cosmos DB
InvocationCounter	Data model for the counter document
Run() method	The core HTTP-triggered function
Cosmos DB container	Stores the single counter document
UpsertItemAsync	Saves the incremented counter safely
EnsureCosmosResourcesExistAsync()	Creates DB/container if they don‚Äôt exist
