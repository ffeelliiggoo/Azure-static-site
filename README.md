# Felipe Gonzalez Resume hosted in Azure
I built this page as part of the Cloud Guru Azure Resume Challenge, leveraging Azure's powerful ecosystem to deploy a fully functional static website. By integrating Functions, Azure Storage for hosting and Cosmos DB for seamless data management. This project allowed me to dive deep into real-world cloud infrastructure design, optimize performance, and enhance my expertise in deploying secure, scalable solutions on Microsoft Azureâ€”all while having some fun with cutting-edge tech!

## First steps:

- Frontend  folder contains website.
- Backend folder contains API and infrastructure assets and instructions.
