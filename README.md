# Static site hosted in Azure Storage

This project showcases a static website hosted on Azure Storage using serverless architecture. 
It features an Azure Function in C# that processes web requests and connects to Cosmos DB for data management, with user authentication handled through Azure Identity. 
The setup enables fast, scalable performance without server maintenance.

Below, I would like to acknowledge and give credit, in ascending order, to the main videos I followed to integrate each part of the site.

## Prerequisites
Make sure to look at these components first; otherwise, you may spend a lot of time and effort just adjusting your machine. 
Ensure that the proper downloads and extensions are set before starting the overall project for a better experience.

## Front-end resources
The front-end is a static website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Despite being static, it includes a dynamic feature‚Äîa visitor counter. The counter‚Äôs data is retrieved through an API call to an Azure Function, enabling real-time updates on visitor traffic.

- [Azure storage explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/) is a handy tool to use when working with Storage Accounts

## Back-end resources

The back-end is powered by an [HTTP triggered Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook-trigger?tabs=csharp) Azure Function, integrated with Cosmos DB using both input and output bindings. When the function is triggered, it retrieves an item from Cosmos DB, increments its value by 1, updates the database, and returns the updated value to the caller.

## üîê Securing Azure Function Secrets

The `main.bicep` file in the infrastructure folder handles Azure Function secrets‚Äîspecifically the Cosmos DB connection string‚Äîusing secure, recommended practices. This avoids hardcoding sensitive data in code or pipeline variables.

### ‚úÖ Secret Handling Workflow

#### 1. Key Vault Provisioning  
- An Azure Key Vault is deployed with RBAC enabled for secure access management.

#### 2. Secret Storage  
- The Cosmos DB connection string is retrieved and stored in Key Vault as a secret named `CosmosDbConnectionString`.

#### 3. Identity-Based Access  
- The Azure Function App is assigned a **system-managed identity**.
- This identity is granted the `Key Vault Secrets User` role to enable secure secret retrieval.

#### 4. Configuration Using Key Vault Reference  
- The application setting is configured to **reference** the secret from Key Vault, rather than storing it directly:
  ```bicep
  CosmosDbConnectionString: '@Microsoft.KeyVault(VaultName=${keyVaultName};SecretName=CosmosDbConnectionString)'
#### 5. Runtime Access in Application Code
At runtime, the Azure Function accesses the secret like this:
var connStr = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("CosmosDbConnectionString");


### üöÄ Azure DevOps Pipeline Overview

## üöÄ Azure DevOps Pipeline Overview

The Azure DevOps pipeline automates the build and deployment process for a web application consisting of:

- A **.NET-based backend Azure Function**  
- A **static frontend** hosted in Azure Blob Storage  

The pipeline triggers automatically on commits to the `master` branch.

### üì¶ Key Pipeline Variables

- `azureSubscription`: Azure service connection for deployment  
- `functionAppName`: Target Azure Function App name  
- `vmImageName`: Agent VM image (`windows-latest`)  
- `workingDirectory`: Backend Function app path  
- `blobStorageAccount` and `blobContainerName`: Storage location for frontend assets  
- `frontendDirectory`: Path to static frontend files  

---

### üîß Stage 1: Build

This stage compiles the backend and uploads the frontend assets.

1. **Build Backend (.NET)**  
   - Uses the `DotNetCoreCLI` task to build the Azure Function  
   - Output is stored in the `publish_output` folder  

2. **Archive Output**  
   - Uses `ArchiveFiles` to compress the build into a `.zip` file  

3. **Upload Frontend**  
   - Uses `AzureCLI` with PowerShell to upload files to Blob Storage:  
     ```bash
     az storage blob upload-batch
     ```

4. **Publish Artifacts**  
   - The backend `.zip` file is published as a build artifact named `drop`  

---

### üöÄ Stage 2: Deploy

This stage handles backend deployment.

1. **Deploy to Azure Function App**  
   - The `.zip` artifact is deployed using the `AzureFunctionApp` task  
   - Deployment is gated to run only after a successful build stage  

---

### üß© Summary

- The **frontend** is automatically uploaded to Blob Storage with each commit  
- The **backend** Azure Function is securely built and deployed using serverless practices  
- Secrets are handled with **Key Vault**, **RBAC**, and **Key Vault references** for secure, maintainable infrastructure
